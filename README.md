# Feel-Your-Feelings

## Description
For this project we will be building a full stack mern app! We want to solve a real life problem and our site will be user friendly. 4
An app designed for anyone who has a hard time finding time for themselves. With this app you can make time for yourself by picking a type of mood. A user will then be presented with drink options and a playlist to enjoy your drink and indulge in some self care.

## User Story
Based on the user’s current mood/feels, they will be able to signup to the HomeAlone app
They will be asked a question, “How do you feel today?”
Emojis representing different moods will be displayed for the user to select
Based on the user’s mood, a playlist, a cocktail and dinner/snack will be recommended. 
The page color scheme will change based on the user’s mood.
